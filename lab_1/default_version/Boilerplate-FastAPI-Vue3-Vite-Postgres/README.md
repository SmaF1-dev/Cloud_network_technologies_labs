## 🛠️ Quickstart

Make sure you have **Docker** installed and running.

### Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SteynGuelen/Boilerplate-FastAPI-Vue3-Vite-Postgres.git
   cd Boilerplate-FastAPI-Vue3-Vite-Postgres
   ```

2. Start all services:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the services:
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:8000/api](http://localhost:8000/api)
   - Swagger Docs: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

If you only want to work on the frontend with hot module reload:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

It will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Production

1. Build and start production services:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
   ```

2. Access:
   - Frontend: [http://your-server-ip:8088](http://your-server-ip:8088)

## 🧩 Why This Boilerplate?

This boilerplate was primarily created for my personal projects, so I can easily jumpstart fullstack applications.  
Most public templates had a bit too much, so I created my own.

The focus is on simplicity, extensibility, and real-world usability:
- Clean, minimalistic starting point
- Includes user registration and login out of the box
- Ready for projects that need secure APIs and authenticated frontends
- Easy to deploy without additional setup

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Hot Module Reloading (HMR) for the frontend doesn't work properly when using Docker with WSL2 on Windows. (Works fine when running `npm run dev` directly, but no backend then.)
- On very first frontend load, Vue Router might enter a `router-view` container state early. Needs fixing.
